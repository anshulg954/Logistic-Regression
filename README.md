# Logistic-Regression
Implementing Logistic Regression from a Neural Network.

Things learnt were,
*Preprocessing the dataset is important.*
*You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().*
*Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!*
