# Logistic-Regression
Implementing Logistic Regression from a Neural Network.

Things learnt were,
Preprocessing the dataset is important.
You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!
Finally, if you'd like, we invite you to try different things on this Notebook. Make sure you submit before trying anything. Once you submit, things you can play with include:
