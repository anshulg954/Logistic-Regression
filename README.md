# Logistic-Regression
Implementing Logistic Regression from a Neural Network.<br />

Things learnt were,<br />
*Preprocessing the dataset is important.*<br />
*You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().*<br />
*Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm.*<br />
